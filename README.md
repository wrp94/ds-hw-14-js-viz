Homework for Module 14 - Interactive Visualizations

## Summary

In this assignment, I used Plotly.js to create an interactive dashboard for bellybutton microbe data. The original study can be found [`here`](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data). Data is loaded in from an API request using D3.js and gets filtered by the user to show results from a singe individual at a time.
